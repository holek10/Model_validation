# Model validation 

Web application built using R and Shiny web framework.
Developed  back in days when I was a consultant in Financial Services Advisory of EY (previously Ernst & Young), Prague, Czech Republic.

The code is a bit messy since back then I wasn't following any software developers guides.
Originally it was developed under shiny package 0.7.0 with Bootstrap 2, only recently I've made adjustements to take advanteage of shinyDashboard layout. 

Enjoy :)
